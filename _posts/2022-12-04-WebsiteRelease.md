## Welcome

after I spend again some houres playing with Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theam on my local PC and on GitHub it should be enove for a MVP. Look and Feel is minemalistisch, boilerplate content is avalible, inital functionality is configguerd and the local "development" enviroment is functional. 

> I have no excuse to work and releasing real content. 

It is december 2022. I`m currently slowly recoverring from a cold. So I will not and can't spend time on outside sport instade I will spend some more time on my PC and the outcome you will eventually see in my next posts.
