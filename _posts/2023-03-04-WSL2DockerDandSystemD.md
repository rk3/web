## WSL2 DockerD and SystemD

After some Month I wrote just now a new HowTo. In this HowTo I documented the reasosn and also how I configgured WSL, DockerD on Linux/Ubuntu/WSL and on Windows to work/play efficent. Exept of a issue with Windows and Linux file Phases together with Visual Studio Developmentcontainers I like it. Have a loot at [WSL2 DockerD and SystemD](/docs/HowTos/WSLDockerSystemD/).
Also this WebSite based on Jeckl II runs on my local Windows PC in WLS and devcontainers. On my Mac this is still now configgured on the Host direct, but Devcontainers should also work on Mac ;-)
