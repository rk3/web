## First How To (started)

My current Azure Subscription will be not any more extended (after around 10 Years of some monthly free credit). This forced my to move some important/necessary Azure configurations form my current subscription to a total new one. For example my Azure DNS Server. 
Now I used the time to document my configurations for this web site. From DNS Name, DNS Server and GitHub Pages. 
Have a look at this HowTo [From DNS to GitHub Pages](/docs/HowTos/DNSandGitHubPages/)
