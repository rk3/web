## What is this Site about
I like to use this side together with the assosiated github repo to share "content". Content will start with some vector based drawings and IT HoTo`s (Setups, Configurations, ...). 

**This is a private side and has nothing to do with my professional work.**

I work as an IT Consultant, Coach and also at Projects. One of my hoppy is also IT. So the is some topic overlapping but I create this content in my leisure time and dosen`t contains corperate and client intellectual properties. So that I can share it with you public.
